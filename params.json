{"name":"Groovy2json","tagline":"Implementation to deep convert Groovy objects to JSON","body":"Convert Groovy objects to Json\r\n===========\r\n\r\nThis project intends to deep convert Groovy objects to Json string.  \r\n\r\nI my latest project I was tasked to convert Groovy object to Json, including all the fields - be it another class or a collection.  \r\n\r\nI was not able to find an easy way to do this in Groovy by default. The default 'as Json' method was not able to include collection values in the output Json.  \r\n\r\nHence I create this class to deep convert Groovy object to Json string.  \r\n\r\nIf any one is faced with similar problem they can refer to the attached class. Or if someone has a better approach, feel free to leave a message to me.  \r\n\r\nThanks.\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file! It's used internally to help with page regeneration."}
